<h1>Lamborghini miura</h1>
<h2><p>Very few cars managed to change the automobile world like the Miura. With its central V12 engine and fascinating body, the two-seater of the iconic car manufacturer redefined the concept of a sports car.</p><p>As proof of that, at its debut, the Miura was the fastest production car in the world: With a top speed of 280 km/h and an acceleration of 0 to 100 km/h in 6.7 seconds, the Lamborghini Miura set new standards in the sports cars segment.</p></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><img src="C:\Users\gopig\OneDrive\Desktop\content\italian\miura.jpeg" alt="" height="450"></h2>
<h2><p>Thanks to its groundbreaking design and the unmistakable and fascinating "eyelashes," 475 units of the 350 CV Miura were produced. But the success story did not end there. The Miura was developed further into the Miura S with 370 CV and later into the Miura SV, which had wider mudguards and a greatly revamped 385 CV engine with separate lubricating systems for the engine and gearbox.</p></h2>
<h1>
    LAMBORGHINI COUNTACH
</h1>
<h2><p>The first Countach generation was named LP 400. Its 4-liter V12 engine was mounted lengthwise (Longitudinale Posteriore, hence the `LP`) and produced 375 CV. A maximum speed of 309 km/h and an acceleration of 0 to 100 km/h in 5.4 seconds proved that the LP 400 was not only a stunning sight, but also offered the expected top-notch performance Lamborghini stood for.</p></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><img src="C:\Users\gopig\OneDrive\Desktop\content\italian\countach.jpeg" alt="" height="450"></h2>
<h2><p>Together with the Miura, the Countach represented the backbone of the Lamborghini legend. Once again, designer Marcello Gandini managed to draw a fascinating, unconventional car that left everybody speechless.</p><p>Still today, the Countach - especially the LP 400 of the first series - is in great demand, most notably because of the iconic visuals of this version, such as the characteristic shape, lack of large mudguards, and rear spoilers. 151 units of the Countach LP 400 were produced between 1974 and 1978.</p></h2>
<h1>
    LAMBORGHINI DIABLO
</h1>
<h2><p>It was 1990, the bosses at Lamborghini had wished for a maximum speed of at least 320 km/h, and the engineers made this wish come true. With a top speed of 325 km/h and acceleration of 0 to 100 km/h in 4.5 seconds, the Diablo claimed the pole position in the super sports cars segment.</p></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><img src="C:\Users\gopig\OneDrive\Desktop\content\italian\Lamborghini_Diablo.jpeg" alt="" height="450"></h2>
<h2><p>The Diablo was destined to become the worthy heir of the renowned Miura and Countach. This new supercar was wide, low, and futuristic. And just like its predecessors, it soon became a favourite among car enthusiasts across the world.</p><p>The Diablo was produced between 1990 and 2001. During this period, Lamborghini introduced several variations of the Diablo concept, which contributed to building Lamborghini's legend and were extremely successful in terms of sales: almost 3,000 units were sold across the world.</p></h2>
<h1>
    Ferrari 250 GT Berlinetta Lusso
</h1>
<h2><p>The Berlinetta Lusso was positioned between Ferrari's more overtly racing models and up-market luxury offerings: essentially sporty in nature and with its V12 fuelled by three Weber carburettors, it still managed a few concessions to driving comfort. Scaglietti bodied all but a few of the cars produced. The 250 GT Berlinetta Lusso, which made its debut at the 1962 Paris Salon, was the final model in the 250 GT series in pure road car form and continued in production until the latter part of 1964, by which time 350 cars had been produced. It was the direct replacement for the 250 GT Coupé, as although there was a 'Lusso' street version of the 250 GT 'passo corto' Berlinetta, this didn't have an excess of interior or luggage space.</p></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><img src="C:\Users\gopig\OneDrive\Desktop\content\italian\1964-ferrari-250-gt-l-berlinetta-lusso-pass-front.jpg" alt="" height="450"></h2>
<h2><p>The body styling from Pininfarina (production cars were built by Scaglietti in Modena) on immediate praise, and featured a front-end design with a wide and low egg crate grille similar to the 250 GT 'SWB' Berlinetta. It had a three-piece bumper arrangement, with a horizontal bar below the grille and a small vertical bumperette cradling the side/turn light on each front wing, with inbuilt circular driving lights between them and the grille. The front wing line curved over the wheel arches to fall gently through the door panel, with the rear wing line running from the door shut line, skirting the base of the rear quarter glass, before falling in a long curve into the Kamm tail panel, which had a shallow aerodynamic lip to its upper edge.</p></h2>
<h1>
    Ferrari F40
</h1>
<h2><p>The F40 continued the extreme machine philosophy cultivated by its predecessor the GTO, but took it to new levels. It was greeted with great enthusiasm by enthusiasts and the number of examples eventually built exceeded the company's wildest dreams. During the mid-eighties there were various spy pictures in motoring magazines of a radical prototype(s) around the streets of Maranello, with all sorts of hypothesis as to its raison d'etre. It subsequently transpired that the car was what became known as the "Evoluzione", a test bed for the upcoming F40.</p></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><img src="C:\Users\gopig\OneDrive\Desktop\content\italian\f40.jpg" alt="" height="450"></h2>
<h2><p>A total of five "Evoluzione" models were built for evaluation purposes, four of which were eventually sold to private clients, and the fifth retained by the factory. When the F40 was eventually announced in the middle of 1987 its Pininfarina designed body took everybody's breath away, it was raw and mean, a car that looked like a racing model, but that was totally road legal and could be driven to the shops if desired. The F40 model title was derived from "F" for Ferrari and 40 represented the fortieth anniversary of Ferrari car production. It was also the last new car presentation attended by Enzo Ferrari before his death in August 1988.</p></h2>
<h1>
    FERRARI TESTAROSA
</h1>
<h2><p>The evolution of the 12-cylinder boxer engine saw it equipped with four valves per cylinder: the most powerful engine mounted on a production sports car at the time of its launch. The Testarossa was a model that took its name from the company's history, being derived from the successful 500 and 250 Testa Rossa series of sports racing cars from the late fifties.</p></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><img src="C:\Users\gopig\OneDrive\Desktop\content\italian\ferrari-testarossa-1.jpg" alt="" height="400"></h2>
<h2><p>The name Testa Rossa is Italian for Red Head, and refers to the colour that the camshaft covers were painted on the sports racing models. Naturally the modern bearer of the name followed suit with red painted camshaft covers. It made its debut in the glittering surroundings of the Lido nightclub on the Champs Elysées in Paris, on the eve of the 1984 Paris Salon, where invited press and guests were given a gala preview prior to its public launch the following day.</p></h2>
<h1>
    Alfa Romeo Tipo 33 Stradale
</h1>
<h2><p>Whenever talk about Italian mid-engined supercars of the 60s, most people remember Lamborghini Miura and De Tomaso Mangusta, or even Ferrari Dino. In fact, Alfa Romeo produced a ground-breaking supercar in 1967. It was Tipo 33 Stradale, or "Type 33 Street" in English.</p></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><img src="C:\Users\gopig\OneDrive\Desktop\content\italian\alfa-romeo-33-stradale.jpeg" alt="" height="350"></h2>
<h2><p>Many car stylists regard the 33 Stradale as one of the most beautiful designs of all time. Its bodywork was designed by Franco Scaglione, a freelance designer previously headed Bertone studio. Like the contemporary Lamborghini Miura and Ferrari Dino, the 33 Stradale emphasized a wedge shape front and wave shape side profile.</p><p>33 Stradale was Alfa's first mid-engined road car (and still the only one until today). Its all-alloy, quad-cam V8 sat longitudinally behind the cockpit and drove the rear wheels via a racing-style 6-speed gearbox and limited slip differential. The 90-degree V8 was designed for racing, this can be seen by its dry-sump lubrication, oversquare combustion chambers (78mm bore x 52.2mm stroke), twin spark plugs per cylinder (a usual technology for Alfa's racing engines), mechanical fuel injection, 10.0:1 compression and small capacity at 1995 cc to comply with the regulation. No wonder it produced 230 horsepower at a sky-high 8800 rpm and 148 lbft of torque at 7000 rpm. (The race car with 11.0:1 compression could even squeeze out 270 hp). That's 115 horsepower per litre without forced induction!!</p></h2>
<h1>
    LANCIA STRATOS HF
</h1>
<h2><p>Born from the ingenuity of Nuccio Bertone and the intuition of Cesare Fiorio, the Stratos is the combination of a revolutionary design and an overwhelming soul from its Ferrari engine.</p></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><img src="C:\Users\gopig\OneDrive\Desktop\content\italian\lancia stratos.jpeg" alt=""></h2>
<h2><p>Lancia’s racing director, Cesare Fiorio, wanted to build a racing car to substitute the glorious Fulvia HF, whose career was coming to an end. Nuccio Bertone, the famed coachbuilder, provided inspiration in 1970, by presenting a futuristic prototype in Turin: the Lancia Strato’s Zero. The rally version of this car, powered by the thrust of a Ferrari engine, would lead to the creation of the legendary Lancia Stratos HF</p><p>Talented men of the likes of Mike Parkes, Gian Paolo Dallara and Sandro Munari allowed the Stratos to dominate a long period of motorsport, especially in rallies!</p></h2>
